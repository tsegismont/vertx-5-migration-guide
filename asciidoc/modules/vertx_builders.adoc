= {VertX} builders

{VertX} {v5} has introduced the usage of the builder pattern that facilitate component configuration with instances of objects.

Until {v5}, such customisation was usually supported by options.

.Customizing a Vertx instance in {VertX} {v4x}
[source,java]
----
Future<Vertx> future = Vertx.clusteredVertx(options.setClusterManager(clusterManager));
----

The builder pattern provide a clean and simple alternative to separate _configuration_ and _customization_.

.Customizing a Vertx instance in {VertX} {v5}
[source,java]
----
Future<Vertx> f = Vertx
  .builder()
  .with(options)
  .withClusterManager(clusterManager)
  .buildClustered();
----

This pattern has been adopted whenever possible in {VertX} {v5} and will be detailed on a per component basis.
