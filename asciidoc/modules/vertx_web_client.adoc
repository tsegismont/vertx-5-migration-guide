= {VertX} Web Client

== Response expectation replacement

Vert.x Core introduces a new API to implement expectation checks inspired from the Web Client response expectation feature.

The Vert.x HTTP Client comes with the same set of predefined expectations than the Web Client response expectations, more importantly HTTP client response expectations can be re-used by Web Client.

HTTP response expectations leverages the new `Future#expecting` operation combined with the `HttpResponseExpectation` implementation.
