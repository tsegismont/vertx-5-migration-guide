= {VertX} Hazelcast

== Upgrade to Hazelcast 5.3

This version includes many security fixes since Hazelcast 4.2.8.
It requires JDK 11 to run, which is now the minimum required version in {VertX5}.

The cluster manager is also tested with Hazelcast 5.4 and Hazelcast 5.5.
But these versions require JDK 17 and JDK 21 as a minimum, respectively.
Therefore, we cannot use them by default.
