= {VertX} Health Check

== Health checks dependencies improvements

Previously, Vert.x Health Check depended on Vert.x Web and Vert.x Auth. It now only defines the health check API, the health check route handler has been moved to Vert.x Web.

This result in a package change in import declarations.
