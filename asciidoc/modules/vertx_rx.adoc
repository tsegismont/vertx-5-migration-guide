= {VertX} Reactive Extensions

== Data object changes

A few classes of {VertX} which have been historically annotated with `@VertxGen` and thus considered as asynchronous types have been converted to data objects.

As consequence reactive streams like generators will not need anymore to wrap/unwrap this type which avoids un-necessary allocation.

This implies that these objects are not anymore wrapped by {VertX} RX and the type will have their package name changed.

The following classes have been promoted to data objects:

- `io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer`
- `io.vertx.core.net.HostAndPort`
- `io.vertx.core.net.SocketAddress`
- `io.vertx.core.net.SelfSignedCertificate`
- `io.vertx.core.MultiMap`
- `io.vertx.core.datagram.DatagramPacket`
- `io.vertx.core.dns.MxRecord`
- `io.vertx.core.dns.SrvRecord`
- `io.vertx.core.file.FileProps`
- `io.vertx.core.file.FileSystemProps`
- `io.vertx.core.http.Cookie`
- `io.vertx.core.http.HttpFrame`
- `io.vertx.core.http.WebSocketFrame`
- `io.vertx.core.json.JsonEvent`

Among all the types above, the {VertX} buffer type is likely the most impacting change.

`io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer` has historically been part of the API as an async generated type, annotated by `@VertxGen`. It has always been wrapped/unwrapped with reactive stream based like generators.

[source,java]
----
// 4.x
io.vertx.reactivex.core.buffer.Buffer buffer = rxApi.getBuffer();

// 5.0
io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer buffer = rxApi.getBuffer();
----

or

[source,java]
----
// 4.x
stream.write(io.vertx.reactivex.core.buffer.Buffer.buffer("the-string"));

// 5.0
stream.write(io.vertx.core.buffer.Buffer.buffer("the-string"));
----

The same applies to the other types mentioned.
